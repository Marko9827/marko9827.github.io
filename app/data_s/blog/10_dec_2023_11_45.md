# AI IN CYBER SECURITY - SECURITY ZONE

AI is also used, which simulates and learns from every second and up to the results of a cyber attack. Simulations last from 3 to 5 minutes.

4 AIs in two groups participate in the simulation.

The task of the first group is to destroy the defense of the second group

while the task of the other group is to defend themselves and if they give in, learn from their mistakes and how they were attacked.

While others use AI for safety in the form of a chat that recommends what you should do...

The process has been going on since 2015...

The AI is meant to fight against the falling AI.

2019 AI named Interceptor is introduced in Security system and protects servers.

Outside the simulation the Interceptor protected and neutralized through:

| Name    | Number  | First attack | Last attack |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| DOS     | 5,410   | 2014         | 2023        |
| Malware | 4,501   | 2016         | 2020        |
| Other   | 950,000 | 2014         | 2023        |

In simulations:

Over 45 million DOS attacks

Over 600 million

Duties and purpose of the AI Interceptor:

- Protects the system from attacks
- Learn from your mistakes and successes

If the attacker attacks more than 3 times, the AI interceptor is allowed to attack back.

The system was later named AI SECURITY GROUP.

After August 2023, not a single attack happened and the AI continued

with simulations...

P.S The first purpose of AI was defense against another entity. More precisely than AI or **hypothetically** some other Entity. Now there are over 250 uses...
