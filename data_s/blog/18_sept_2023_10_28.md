Eronelit OS - App loading screen

With technology, you will always have two options:

1. To use it to make one and the same thing, to work for someone or yourself...
2. To use it to develop your brand new technology in secret that Mankind has never seen before!
   When do you finish it and show it? People will tell you: Impossible! How about overnight?...

* I chose the second option. And you?!

P.S Imagine a program that can run outside the device. Without CPU, RAM, GPU, SSD/HDD...
Imagine that there is something billions of years more advanced than even this...

P.S Is example story. But what if true?! Now? In future or in past?...
Tip: Be careful with the quantum CPU, during the cooling replacement!
