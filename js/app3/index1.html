                        Like most website operators Political Technology services such as MyUPSite, MyGOPSite and MyPoliticalSite (hereafter collectively referred to as “MPS”) collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Political Technology’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MPS visitors use its website. From time to time, Political Technology may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                        <br />
                        Political Technology also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Political Technology does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
                        <br />
                        Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
                        <br />
                        Certain visitors to MPS websites choose to interact with Political Technology in ways that require Political Technology to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Political Technology gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Political Technology – by purchasing a premium web site or add-on – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Political Technology collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Political Technology. Political Technology does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
                        <br />
                        Aggregated Statistics
                        <br />
                        Political Technology may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Political Technology may monitor the most popular blogs on the site or use spam service to help identify spam. Political Technology may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Political Technology does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                        <br />
                        Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
                        <br />
                        Political Technology discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Political Technology’s behalf or to provide services available at MPS websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MPS websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Political Technology will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Political Technology discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Political Technology believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Political Technology, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an MPS website and have supplied your email address, Political Technology may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Political Technology and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Political Technology takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

                        Cookies
                        <br />
                        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Political Technology uses cookies to help Political Technology identify and track visitors, their usage of MPS websites, and their website access preferences. MPS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MPS’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of MPS’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
                        <br />
                        Privacy Policy Changes
                        <br />
                        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Political Technology may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Political Technology’s sole discretion. Political Technology encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a mypoliticalsite.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
